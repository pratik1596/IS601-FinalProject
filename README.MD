# __IS601 - Final Project__

### __Description:__
This project shows how we created HTML forms to create new records, update records, and a small form that has no fields other than a submit button to delete records. 

### __Dataset used:__    
https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html

This is a .csv file of MLB Teams from 2012. The records contain attributes such as Name, Payroll and Wins.

### __SQL Converter:__ 
https://sqlizer.io/#/

This converter converts 100 CSV records into SQL inserts.

### __Project Details:__
The project is built following the steps in the tutorial https://hackersandslackers.com/your-first-flask-application 
Steps 1 to 4 are covered as this project is an extension of Project 3.
The next steps are according to the tutorial on different branches.
Some steps did not have significant change in project hence the branches are not consecutive.
